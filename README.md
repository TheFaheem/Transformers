## Introduction

Here I present a My Comprehensive Implementation of the Transformers architecture from scratch, which serves as the foundation for many of the current state-of-the-art language models. By practically applying the deep learning knowledge and NLP principles I've acquired thus far, I'm Able to Build this from ground up, which helps me understand the inner working of the transfomer neural network. This repository showcases my commitment to mastering the intricacies of advanced NLP models and translating theoretical knowledge into practical implementation.

## Motivation

As a NLP Enthusiast, I was just curios to demystify the renowned Transformers architecture. I wanted to go beyond the surface and understand the inner workings of attention mechanisms, positional encodings, and self/casual attention.

## What Sets This Repository Apart
